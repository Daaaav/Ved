--[[
	Quick overview:

	The playtesting UI state controls the interface, and the engine state tracks the state of the
	playtesting thread. Normally, the UI state is OFF (playtesting_uistate == PT_UISTATE.OFF).
	When the user presses the play button or presses Enter, it calls playtesting_start(force_ask_path)
	which then sets the UI state to ASKING. Then when they indicate where they want to start,
	playtesting_endaskwherestart() will call playtesting_execute(), which sets the UI state to
	PLAYTESTING, and tells the playtesting thread to open VVVVVV with the level.

	The engine state can be one of the following:
	OFF - The thread is not running
	IDLE - The thread is running and (almost) waiting to receive level data and starting position
	PLAYTESTING - Currently playtesting (cannot be stopped by user except by closing VVVVVV)
	CANCELING - Going from IDLE to OFF, thread is terminating

	In which states VVVVVV is or isn't running depends on the VVVVVV version and is up to the thread.
	For example, VVVVVV 2.3 is only started when going to the PLAYTESTING state, but VVVVVV 2.4+ can
	already be started when going to IDLE (and will thus be shut down in the CANCELING state)

	When the thread terminates, it will give a message via its out channel.
	This can be PT_RESULT.DONE for success, or PT_RESULT.ERROR followed by a message for an error.
	This result being received is the only thing that can change the engine state from any other
	state to OFF, and the engine state needs to be OFF before the thread can be started again.
